# twitch-tv-stream

This is a Freecodecamp project I completed. It is a Twitch stream viewer I created using the Twitch.tv api. The requirments are listed below It sorts by online-offline-all and shows the channel's current status. View this project live at https://thenewstyles.github.io/twitch-tv-stream/



Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
